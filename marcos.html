            <br><h2 class="TitleText">Brief History</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
                When Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law in the Philippines, he used his constitutionally legal powers to concentrate all state authority in himself. However, this would not be the last time Marcos would use technicalities in his mandate as head of state to obtain even greater power. In mere months following September 1972, Marcos had already set in motion an elaborate plan that would eliminate his checks and balances from both the other branches of government and the Filipino people at large. In everything he did, Ferdinand Marcos took great pains to ensure that his actions would align with the dictates of the law. When necessary measures fell outside the scope of existing laws, he changed the laws to suit his needs before proceeding. For implementing such a strategy his rapid ascent to what seemed at the time like absolute power, Marcos has been labeled a constitutional dictator.

            <br><h2 class="TitleText">Pros</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
                
                <br><br>While the 1973 Constitution of the Philippines during Marcos' presidency is often criticized for contributing to authoritarian rule, there were some perceived advantages during its implementation. It's important to note that these points are based on historical context and opinions may vary. Here are some potential pros:

                <br><br>Economic Development: The Marcos regime implemented economic policies that led to some degree of growth and development during the early years of the constitution.

                <br><br>Infrastructure Projects: There was an emphasis on infrastructure development, with the construction of highways, bridges, and buildings.

                <br><br>Land Reform: The constitution included provisions for land reform, aiming to address issues related to land ownership and distribution.

                <br><br>Discipline and Order: The declaration of martial law brought about a period of perceived discipline and order, as the government sought to quell unrest and maintain stability.

                <br><br>Foreign Relations: The Marcos administration managed to strengthen diplomatic ties with various countries during this period.
                
            </p>

                <br><h2 class="TitleText">Cons</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
                The 1973 Constitution of the Philippines, had several perceived shortcomings or cons:

                <br><br>Concentration of Power: The 1973 Constitution centralized power in the hands of the President, allowing Marcos to rule by decree and effectively control all branches of government. This concentration of power had significant implications for the democratic institutions in the country.
                <br><br>Martial Law: The 1973 Constitution provided the legal basis for the declaration of martial law in 1972. This period of authoritarian rule allowed Marcos to suppress political opposition, curtail civil liberties, and control the media.
                <br><br>Economic Policies: The Marcos era saw the implementation of economic policies that favored the elite and close associates of the regime. This resulted in economic inequality and disparities in wealth distribution.
                <br><br>Human Rights Violations: The concentration of power and the declaration of martial law led to widespread human rights abuses. Activists, journalists, and political opponents were arrested, tortured, or disappeared. The regime's security forces were implicated in numerous human rights violations.
                <br><br>Crony Capitalism: The Marcos administration engaged in crony capitalism, where business interests were closely tied to the government. This led to corruption, economic inefficiencies, and a lack of transparency in governance.   
            </p>

            <br><h2 class="TitleText">Effect to the Country</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
                The Malolos Constitution of the Philippines, promulgated on January 21, 1899, had both positive and negative effects on the country. On the positive side, it represented a pivotal moment in Philippine history as the first republican constitution in Asia. It established a framework for a democratic government, with provisions safeguarding civil liberties and recognizing the equality of citizens. However, its implementation faced challenges due to the ongoing Philippine-American War, limiting its impact. Moreover, the Malolos Republic struggled with internal divisions and external pressures, leading to its eventual collapse. While the constitution showcased aspirations for self-governance, its effectiveness was hindered by the turbulent historical context and external forces shaping the Philippine narrative during that period.
                
The 1973 Constitution during Ferdinand Marcos' presidency in the Philippines had both positive and negative impacts on the country. On the positive side, it centralized power, enabling Marcos to implement infrastructural projects and economic initiatives, contributing to a period of economic growth. However, the concentration of power also facilitated widespread corruption, as evidenced by the ill-gotten wealth accumulated by the Marcos family. Additionally, the declaration of martial law in 1972, a precursor to the constitution, led to severe human rights abuses, including censorship, arrests without due process, and extrajudicial killings. The suppression of political opposition stifled democratic processes, creating an environment of fear and silencing dissent. The negative effects ultimately culminated in the People Power Revolution of 1986, which ousted Marcos and restored democracy in the Philippines.

            <p class="post-description">The Political Constitution of 1899, informally known as the Malolos Constitution, was the constitution of the First Philippine Republic. It was written by Felipe Calderón y Roca and Felipe Buencamino as an alternative to a pair of proposals to the Malolos Congress by Apolinario Mabini and Pedro Paterno. After a lengthy debate in the latter part of 1898, it was promulgated on January 21, 1899.
